<h4>3.RESTRICTIONS.</h4>

The rights granted to User in this Agreement are subject to the following restrictions: (a) User shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, outsource, disclose or otherwise commercially exploit the Licensed Software or make the Licensed Software available to any third party; (b) User shall not modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the Licensed Software; (c) User shall not access the Licensed Software in order to build a similar or competitive product or service; (d) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Licensed Software may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means, including but not limited to electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or other means; and (e) any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Licensed Software shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless Tencent expressly states otherwise.  Neither Tencent nor any of its suppliers is obligated to provide any services, updates or upgrades to the Licensed Software.  User shall preserve all copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Licensed Software and all copies thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, decompiling the Licensed Software is permitted to the extent the laws of User’s jurisdiction give User the right to do so to obtain information necessary to render the Licensed Software interoperable with other software; provided, however, that User must first request such information from Tencent and Tencent may, in its discretion, either provide such information to User or impose reasonable conditions, including a reasonable fee, on such use of the Licensed Software to ensure that Tencent’s proprietary rights in the Licensed Software are protected.

<h4>4.OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.</h4>

Certain items of independent, third-party code may be included in the Licensed Software that are subject to various “open source” or “free software” licenses (“<b>Open Source Software</b>”).  The current list of Open Source Software is attached hereto as Appendix A.  We may supplement such list from time to time for any updates or upgrades to the Licensed Software.  Such Open Source Software is licensed under the terms of the license that accompanies such Open Source Software.  Nothing in this Agreement limits User’s rights under, or grants User rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end user license for such Open Source Software.

<h4>9.BASIS OF BARGAIN.</h4>

The warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the agreement between Tencent and User.
